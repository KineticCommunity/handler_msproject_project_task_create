=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a REST call Microsoft Project Online to the Project Server
API to create a task under a specified Project. After authenticating against 
the Project Server using the inputted username and password, the handler first 
makes a call to Project to get a FormDigestValue which is needed as a part of the 
authentication for future calls. That value is then used along with the Project 
Id, Task Name, and Task Note (if included) parameters to make a POST request to 
the API to create the Task. Any errors that occur during this process will be 
caught and re-raised by the handler.

NOTE: The Microsoft Project handlers uses ADFS authentication 
(ADFS docs [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb897402.aspx]) and requires a 
minimum of .NET 4.0 to be installed on the server that Kinetic Task is running 
on. If you have any questions about this setup, contact support@kineticdata.com.
